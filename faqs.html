			<p id="q1"></p>
			<h4>How can I book a course?</h4>
			<p><i> - Just contact us by e-mail. We will send you all the necessary information via mail.</i></p>
			<p id="q2"></p>
			<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
			<p><i> - Our courses are priced competitively but while the price may be similar to other courses, the quality of the programme is exceptional and the limited number of participants ensures personal and personalised attention to each student. Please contact us with your requirements, the dates and number of weeks for an exact quotation.</i></p>
			<p id="q3"></p>
			<h4>How many weeks are the courses for Juniors?</h4>
			<p><i> - The standard course is 2 weeks, but additional time can be added on.</i></p>
			<p id="q4"></p>
			<h4>What documents do I need to complete or organise for my child?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><p><i> -   Complete Booking Form (be sure to include any allergy/medication information)</i></p></li>
				<li><p><i> - Complete Parental Consent Form</i></p></li>
				<li><p><i> - Complete Travel Authorisation</i></p></li>
				<li><p><i> - Ensure your child has valid European Health Insurance Card</i></p></li>
				<li><p><i> -  Ensure your child’s passport is in date for at least 3 months after travel dates</i></p></li>
				<li><p><i> -  Check check-in information (Aer Lingus requires an indemnity letter for unaccompanied minors) and please also check airline baggage restrictions</i></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p id="q5"></p>
			<h4>Where do I find the booking conditions of the courses? </h4>
			<p><i> - All information on payment, terms, cancellation and booking conditions are supplied at the time of deciding to make a booking</i></p>
			<p id="q6"></p>
			<h4>How do you determine the English language level of the students? </h4>
			<p><i> - All students are given a level test before arrival so that classes and materials can be designed appropriately. The level test also acts as a needs analysis and provides a mini student profile to help with planning activities and matching students and host families.</i></p>
			<p id="q7"></p>
			<h4>What is the schedule of a normal school day?</h4>
			<p><i> - The normal school day is as follows:</i></p>
				<ul>
					<li><i>8am: Breakfast with the family</i></li>
					<li><i>9am: School (meet up/chat/Q & As, ie. any problems discussed and sorted)</i></li>
					<li><i>9.30-12.45: Classes</i></li>
					<br />			
					<li><i>10.55-11.10 Break</i></li>
					<li><i>12.45: Lunch (time for games indoor/outdoor, weather dependant)</i></li>
					<li><i>1.30pm: Afternoon activity (eg. tennis/football) or excursion (eg. museum visit)</i></li>
					<li><i>5pm: Return to Rush and host families</i></li>
					<li><i>6pm: Most Irish families eat dinner around 6 o’clock;</i></li>
					<li><i>Some evenings your teenager will be with the host family; and on other evenings doing school activities (7.30-9.30pm)</i></li>
				</ul>
			<p id="q8"></p>
			<h4>What is the weather like in Rush in the summer and what does my child need to have? </h4>
			<p><i> - While the climate in Ireland is temperate, the weather is always unpredictable! No such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing for the weather! So come prepared with layers. Most families run a wash almost daily, and students just need to ask where to leave laundry for washing, but should have several pairs of undies/socks and general clothing in case of any delay in washing (or more likely, in drying!) . Appropriate clothing includes track suits/jogging pants and several T-shirts and sweaters. Other items suggested: </i></p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Back-pack (airline carry-on luggage) is perfect for school equipment and also excursions</i></li>
				<li><i>Sports shoes (for tennis/football etc) and a second pair (minimum) for walking etc</i></li>
				<li><i>Swimwear (it’s not necessary to bring towels… provided by the family in the home and by the school for water-based activities)</i></li>
				<li><i>Personal toiletries (shampoo/toothbrush/shaving equipment etc)</i></li>
				<li><i>Baseball caps (for rain/sun); rain jacket if possible</i></li>
				<li><i>Night wear… it’s a good idea for students to have something warm to wear at night, and maybe bed socks</i></li>
				<li><i>A warm jacket is recommended just in case! This will also be useful for early morning flights</i></li>
				<li><i>ANY NECESSARY MEDICATION!</i></li>
			</ul>
			<p><i>So, we’re preparing you for potential chilly/damp weather, but be warned! Visitors to Ireland can also get sunburnt! Because there’s always a sea-breeze, and temperatures don’t seem too hot, visitors sometimes don’t bother with sun protection. Please make sure your child has an appropriate sun-protection-factor cream.</i></p>
			<p id="q9"></p>
			<h4>What else does my son/daughter need in Rush?</h4>
			<p><i> - Don’t forget spectacles, phone charger, and any necessary medication!</i></p>
			<p id="q10"></p>
			<h4>What is the international direct dialling code for Ireland?</h4>
			<p><i> - The international direct dialling code for Ireland is +353</i></p>
			<p id="q11"></p>
			<h4>Can our son/daughter call us on arrival?</h4>
			<p><i> - On arrival all students should call their parents. This can be done from the school (ie.our) phone. (In our experience most students have a mobile phone and are happy to text their family on arrival)
And even if your son/daughter wants to phone you but doesn’t have credit and doesn’t want to ask us or the host family, this can be done by using the International Reverse Charge Call Operator. Dial: 18007383773+ number</i></p>
			<p id="q12"></p>
			<h4>What are the emergency numbers in Ireland?</h4>
			<p><i> - Emergency numbers in Ireland: 999 or 112</i></p>
			<p id="q13"></p>
			<h4>Can we buy a SIM card in Ireland?</h4>
			<p><i> - Irish SIM cards can be organised (from Vodafone/3/Meteor) for your child if you wish, but please be sure to have the phone unblocked/get the unblock code well in advance of departure</i></p>
			<p id="q14"></p>
			<h4>Do our children need to have their passport or Id with them?</h4>
			<p><i> - Irish people do not carry ID cards, so passports should be left in the safety of the family home and not carried in case of loss</i></p>
			<p id="q15"></p>
			<h4>How much pocket money should students take with them?</h4>
			<p><i> - The amount of pocket money depends on what you think is appropriate, and to what extent your son/daughter plans to shop for souvenirs/gifts to bring back to you! Students need to be responsible with their money (taking all the normal precautions, ie. not carrying money in outside pocket of their back-pack/not taking all their spending money on sporting activities etc!) and can request the host family to act as a ‘bank’.</i></p>
			<p id="q16"></p>
			<h4>Will we receive info about the host family before departure?</h4>
			<p><i> - Absolutely! You will receive: Full Host Family Details, All Contact Numbers and Detailed Programme of Scheduled Activities before departure, along with some general advice and useful language, and a food questionnaire to inform the host family of food likes/dislikes in advance. We always suggest that you and your child make e-mail of phone contact with the Irish host family before arrival.</i></p>

		<h2>Booking Information</h2>
		<p><i><b>Please read our booking information and conditions carefully and do not hesitate to contact us before booking your course if you have any questions…</b></i> </p>

		<ul>
			<li><p> Firstly, send us an e-mail to request a Booking Form. If you are under the age of 18, your parent or guardian must sign a parental consent form.</p></li>
			<li><p>When we send you the form, please complete it and return to us, at which time we can confirm availability for your booking, course requirements and fees. </p></li>
			<li><p>We will then send you a test for you to complete and return by e-mail so that we can assess your level of English and start making a plan for your course. </p></li>
			<li><p>You will be required to pay an immediate booking deposit of 25% of the course fees by Bank Transfer, with the balance to be paid in full at least 4 weeks before your arrival.  </p></li>
			<li><p>In the event you cancel 60 days before the course start a full refund will be made. If you cancel 30 days before the course there will be a cancellation fee of the deposit ie. 25%. Less than 30 days pre-course cancellation incurs a 70% penalty. If you have insurance, we will do everything to support your claim in the event of cancellation for an insurable reason. If you wish to re book your course for different dates we will do everything possible to accommodate your new booking and allocate fees paid to the new course.  </p></li>
			<li><p>There is no refund for days missed due to late arrival/early departure. </p></li>
			<li><p>At this stage you will need to confirm to us the travel arrangements you’ve made, evidence of visa requirements (if any) you have fulfilled, along with the appropriate insurance. Your personal insurance should cover cancellation or curtailment of your trip, illness or accident. </p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Your course is only finally confirmed when all the necessary documentation and full course fees have been received.</p>
		<h3>The small print (though not too small!) </h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Arrangements for flights into Dublin airport must be confirmed well in advance and any changes notified as early as possible. A phone number will be provided for SMS text messages in the event of last minute delays/changes. </p></li>
			<li><p>Students under the age of 18, unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, must carry a letter of authorisation from a parent or guardian while travelling to and from Ireland. The letter must authorise us by name to collect the student at Dublin airport and assist with check-in on departure and will also require the details of the adult responsible for meeting the student upon their arrival back in their home country. This is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions and is in place to protect your child. </p></li>
			<li><p>Any medical or special dietary requirements must be disclosed at the time of booking to ensure that these needs can be met. </p></li>
